# Docker Compose

In addition to ```docker``` and ```dockerd``` you can manage collections/stack/family's of containers using ```docker-compose```

Docker compose uses a ```YAML``` file to describe collection of containers and the relation to each other.

## Docker Compose Up

To bring up a stack you can use the following

```docker-compose up```

or as with ```docker``` in detached mode

```docker-compose up -d```

## View docker compose containers
```docker-compose ps```

## Docker Compose Down

And to bring the stack down.

```docker-compose down```
